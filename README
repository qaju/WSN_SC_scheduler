Created by Qianao Ju in Feb 20, 2014 to conduct SC based task scheduling experiments

Experimental platform:  CrossBow IRIS
MCU:			Atmega 1281


Version 1.0: Feb 20, 2014
	ADC PIN 4 is used to measure SC terminal voltage.
	MCU internal reference voltage is used to do ADC calibration
	5 Timers are triggered in the experiment:
	Timer 1: periodically measure SC branch V1
	Timer 2: periodically measure SC branch V2
	Timer 3: periodically call tasks scheduler
	Timer 4: periodically reads ADC, ADC measurement timer
	Timer 5: start one shot timer, is used to hold system to do lazy scheduling
