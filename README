Created by Qianao Ju in Feb 20, 2014 to conduct SC based task scheduling experiments

Experimental platform:  CrossBow IRIS
MCU:			Atmega 1281


Version 1.0: Feb 20, 2014
	ADC PIN 4 is used to measure SC terminal voltage.
	MCU internal reference voltage is used to do ADC calibration
	5 Timers are triggered in the experiment:
	Timer 1: periodically measure SC branch V1
	Timer 2: periodically measure SC branch V2
	Timer 3: periodically call tasks scheduler
	Timer 4: periodically reads ADC, ADC measurement timer
	Timer 5: start one shot timer, is used to hold system to do lazy scheduling


Version 1.1: Feb 23, 2014
	Panasonic 22F parameters are included in codes
	Initial value is set to be V1 = V2 =1.5 V
	Software threshold is set to be 1.05 V
	Lazy scheduling delay slot is 500 ms

Version 1.2: Feb 26, 2014
	Fixed serious bug in SC terminal voltage sensor (the order of getPrescaler and getRefVoltage was mixed)
